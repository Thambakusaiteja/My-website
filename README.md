# Photofilo 📸

A small, static profile/portfolio page built with HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. This repository currently contains a single page: `profile.html`.

---

## Contents

- `profile.html` — main profile page
- (Add any images, stylesheets, or scripts in the project root or an `assets/` folder)

## Quick Start ✅

1. Open `profile.html` directly in your browser.
2. Or run a simple static server (recommended for relative paths):

   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Then open: `http://localhost:8000/profile.html`

3. In VS Code, you can use the **Live Server** extension to preview changes instantly.

## Development & Editing 🔧

- Edit `profile.html` to update content, layout, or links.
- Add CSS/JS files and reference them from the page.
- Test on modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) and check responsiveness on mobile.
